## TL;DR

- **Mac transcription has been confusing for far too long.** Apple's built-in dictation can be hidden in settings and still sends some speech to cloud servers; it lacks file transcription and many languages. People often resort to command-line hacks or pay-per-minute services that get expensive fast.
- **[SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app) offers a new way to work.** The macOS-only app runs entirely on your Apple Silicon machine using the Parakeet speech model, so your audio never leaves your device. Hold a global shortcut to dictate into any text field (Push to Talk), or drag multiple audio/video files for batch transcription. One hour of audio is processed in under five minutes and you can export as SRT, VTT, CSV or plain text.
- **Privacy and price set SpeakQuick apart.** There's no cloud upload, no subscription, and no AI-recording bots. A one-time US$38 purchase gives unlimited transcription, 25+ languages with automatic detection, and lifetime updates. A free 7-day trial lets you test without a credit card.
- **Not all tools are created equal.** This guide compares the top 10 Mac transcription applications in 2026 -- MacWhisper, Otter.ai, Descript, Notta, Jamie, Express Scribe, Talkatoo, Rev, HappyScribe and Apple Dictation -- covering pricing, offline capability, pros and cons, and ideal use cases. If you prioritise privacy, speed and cost-predictability, SpeakQuick comes out on top.
- **Cut hours of typing from your week.** Whether you're a writer, journalist, student, researcher or video producer, local transcription speeds up note-taking and reduces RSI fatigue. With the right tool your Mac can finally listen as well as it writes.

## Introduction -- why transcription on Mac still feels broken

Mac's built-in dictation hides deep in settings, and Apple admits it may send your voice to Siri servers for certain languages. That uncertainty and limited language support make many professionals uneasy about recording sensitive interviews or meetings. Meanwhile cloud services charge per minute and require uploads, and the subscription culture persists even when the technology runs locally. With Dragon for Mac discontinued, options felt bleak -- until [SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app) moved the entire speech-to-text pipeline onto your Mac's Neural Engine. This guide explains how it works, compares top competitors and answers common questions about dictation on macOS. It's a comprehensive comparison of transcription software for Mac.

## Does Mac have a transcription app?

Apple ships a feature called Dictation that converts speech to text, but it isn't a full transcription application. On Apple Silicon Macs the dictation engine can run on-device for many languages, but Apple notes that dictation features aren't available in all languages and may still use Siri servers. The built-in feature also can't transcribe pre-recorded audio files or generate time-stamped subtitles.

In short, macOS doesn't include a full transcription app. It offers basic dictation, which is convenient for short messages but limited for longer content or privacy-sensitive work. To transcribe meetings, podcasts or lectures, you'll need a dedicated tool.

## How SpeakQuick transforms dictation on macOS

### Local processing on Apple Silicon

[SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app) runs entirely on your machine. It uses the Parakeet speech model locally and performs post-processing with Qwen and Phi LLMs on the Apple Silicon Neural Engine. That means no internet connection is needed; your audio never leaves your Mac. SpeakQuick can transcribe one hour of audio in under five minutes on Apple Silicon hardware and supports more than 25 languages with automatic detection. The app's smart export system lets you save transcripts as SRT, VTT, JSON, CSV or plain text with precise timestamps.

### Push to Talk and batch file transcription

Most dictation tools either require you to toggle recording on and off or work only inside their own editor. SpeakQuick introduces a Push to Talk system: hold a global shortcut, speak into any Mac application (e-mail, code editor, note-taking app), then release to instantly transcribe your speech into the text field. This approach gives you precise control and eliminates the accidental side conversations that happen with toggle-based apps. For pre-recorded content, you can drag one or multiple audio or video files onto the app; SpeakQuick processes them locally and lets you export transcripts and subtitles.

### Privacy and pricing

Because everything happens on your device, there are no privacy issues associated with cloud uploads or third-party servers. Processing on-device avoids network round-trips, upload latency and privacy questions. SpeakQuick builds on that philosophy with a one-time US$38 licence that includes unlimited transcription, access to all export formats, batch processing and lifetime updates. A seven-day trial lets you test the software without a credit card. This local-first, subscription-free model stands in contrast to many competitors that charge per minute or monthly fees.

## 10 best transcription software for Mac in 2026

The macOS ecosystem has blossomed with transcription tools, from lightweight dictation helpers to full meeting-management platforms. The list below compares ten popular options, highlighting their key features, pricing models, pros and cons, and ideal use cases.

### 1. SpeakQuick

**Overview:** AI-powered transcription and dictation app that runs exclusively on macOS for Apple Silicon that delivers push-button dictation and batch file transcription with 100% local processing. Uses Parakeet for speech recognition and Qwen/Phi for formatting.

**Pricing:** US$38 one-time; free 7-day trial; lifetime updates.

**Key features:** Push to Talk dictation in any app; batch transcription of audio/video files; automatic language detection for 25+ languages; smart exports (SRT, VTT, JSON, CSV, plain text); speaker detection (coming soon); offline operation; Neural Engine acceleration.

**Pros:** Fast (1 h of audio in <5 min); completely private (no cloud); unlimited use without subscription; works in any application; optimized for Apple Silicon.

**Cons:** macOS 15+ only; currently only supports Apple Silicon; speaker detection still in beta; no cloud collaboration features.

**Best for:** Professionals and creatives who need private, fast transcription or dictation across multiple Mac apps and want to avoid recurring fees.

### 2. MacWhisper

MacWhisper is an offline tool based on OpenAI's Whisper model. A free tier handles basic transcription, while the Pro version adds speaker detection and advanced export options. Local processing means you can generate subtitles (SRT/VTT) without internet access. However, the interface is bare-bones, there's no push-to-talk dictation and accuracy depends on your chosen model. Best for podcasters and video creators who need occasional offline transcription.

### 3. Otter.ai

Otter.ai is a cloud-based meeting transcription and note-taking service. Free and paid plans (starting around US$16 per month) let you record Zoom or Google Meet calls, generate live transcripts with speaker labels and summarise action items. Collaboration features and cross-platform apps make it popular for teams, but the service requires internet access and stores your recordings on the cloud, raising privacy and cost concerns.

### 4. Descript

Descript combines AI transcription with a full audio/video editor. Plans start around US$16 per month and include a limited pool of transcription minutes. You edit audio by editing the text, remove filler words and add captions. The tool is powerful for podcasters and creators but relies on cloud processing, carries a monthly cost and has a steep learning curve.

### 5. Notta

Notta provides live transcription and AI summarisation across web and mobile. A free plan includes 120 minutes per month; Pro and Business tiers add more capacity and features. It integrates with video-call platforms and syncs transcripts across devices. Notta also offers iPhone and Android apps for on-the-go dictation, but because it runs in the cloud, you'll need internet access and must trust their servers with your audio files.

### 6. Jamie (meetjamie.ai)

Jamie records your computer's audio locally and then uses cloud AI to transcribe and summarise meetings, generating tasks and notes. Plans range from a free tier (ten meetings per month) to Pro and Team subscriptions. The app shines for collaborative meeting management, but it's subscription-based and geared toward meetings rather than general dictation.

### 7. Express Scribe

Express Scribe is a free (with paid upgrades) audio player designed for manual transcription. It supports foot pedals and variable playback for 45+ file formats. There's no AI transcription, so you'll be typing yourself, but it remains a helpful tool for professional transcriptionists who demand precise control.

### 8. Talkatoo

Talkatoo is a cloud-based speech-to-text platform tailored for veterinary and medical professionals. Subscription plans offer clinical dictation, SOAP-note templates and call summaries. It's ideal for regulated workflows but too niche and expensive for general Mac users.

### 9. Rev

Rev offers both AI and human transcription services. AI transcription costs about US$0.25 per minute and human transcription costs US$1.99 per minute with extra fees for rush delivery. Accuracy is high, especially with human editors, but you pay per minute and must upload audio to Rev's servers.

### 10. Apple Dictation (built-in)

**Overview:** Apple's native Dictation feature on macOS. Handles basic voice-to-text but isn't a fully fledged transcription app.

**Pricing:** Included with macOS; free.

**Key features:** Converts speech to text across the system; works offline for some languages on Apple Silicon; voice control commands; no file transcription.

**Pros:** Free and integrated; quick for short messages and voice typing; accessible via keyboard shortcut.

**Cons:** On-device processing isn't available for all languages; may send audio to Apple servers; limited to live dictation; no time-stamped transcripts; cannot process audio/video files.

**Best for:** Casual users needing quick voice input or those who have no budget for third-party tools.

## Why local processing and one-time pricing matter

Most transcription tools send your audio to remote servers. Apple's own documentation warns that dictation may route speech through Siri servers. Running models locally avoids privacy risks and network lag, and it means you aren't paying per minute or per seat. Offline software doesn't need a subscription, which is why SpeakQuick's US$38 licence offers exceptional value.

## Choosing the right tool for your workflow

Your ideal transcription tool depends on how you work. Writers and students who need to jot ideas into any Mac app will appreciate SpeakQuick's Push to Talk dictation and on-device privacy. Podcasters and video editors might pair SpeakQuick with MacWhisper or Descript for subtitle creation. Teams that prioritise meeting summaries could lean on Jamie or Otter.ai, while medical practices might prefer Talkatoo's templates despite its cost. Manual transcriptionists can combine Express Scribe with automatic tools when accuracy matters most.

## Conclusion -- the Mac finally listens

Mac users have endured limited dictation and inconsistent transcription software, expensive cloud services and discontinued software. By running AI models on your Apple Silicon chip, [SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app) makes transcription private, fast and affordable. A single purchase unlocks unlimited Push to Talk dictation, batch file transcription and smart exports without sending anything to the cloud.

Whatever your workflow -- editing podcasts, managing meetings or taking lecture notes on macOS -- there's a tool for you. If privacy and predictable costs are top priorities, SpeakQuick is the standout choice. For collaboration or integrated editing you might mix it with Jamie, Otter.ai, MacWhisper or Descript. Either way, the days of retyping meetings like a medieval scribe are finally over.

## FAQ

### Does Mac have a transcription app?

macOS includes a Dictation feature that converts speech to text, but it isn't a full transcription application. Dictation may send your voice to Apple's servers for some languages and doesn't process audio files. For proper transcription, especially of recordings, you need third-party software like [SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app).

### Can ChatGPT transcribe audio?

ChatGPT itself doesn't transcribe audio; it's a text-only conversational model. OpenAI's Whisper model handles audio transcription. You can't upload an audio file to the standard ChatGPT interface; instead you must use the Whisper API or tools built on it. Whisper transcribes 30-second segments and ChatGPT can then summarise or analyse the resulting text. Limitations include a 25 MB file size per request and reduced accuracy on noisy audio.

### What is the best dictation software for Mac?

The answer depends on your priorities. For fast, private dictation across any app with no subscription, [SpeakQuick](https://speakquick.app) stands out. If you want built-in meeting summaries and collaboration, Jamie or Otter.ai may suit you. Content creators needing audio/video editing integrated with transcription often choose Descript. For free offline transcription, MacWhisper is a popular option but lacks Push to Talk and integrated dictation.

### Is there a built-in transcription app on Mac?

No. Apple's Dictation feature can convert your voice to text in some fields but it doesn't offer file transcription, time-stamped transcripts or speaker labels. You'll need dedicated software to transcribe recordings or generate subtitles.

### Are there any free transcription apps for Mac?

Yes, but they come with limitations. MacWhisper offers a free tier for offline transcription of short files; you can upgrade for more features. Express Scribe is free if you're willing to transcribe manually. Otter.ai and Notta provide free plans with limited monthly minutes. SpeakQuick offers a free 7-day trial so you can test its local processing before purchasing.

### How does SpeakQuick compare to MacWhisper or Jamie?

SpeakQuick and MacWhisper both run on your Mac without sending audio to the cloud, but they differ in workflow. SpeakQuick supports Push to Talk dictation in any app and batch processing of files, while MacWhisper focuses on file transcription and subtitle generation. SpeakQuick uses the Parakeet model and LLM post-processing, whereas MacWhisper uses Whisper. Jamie records meetings locally but sends them to the cloud for AI analysis and charges a monthly subscription. SpeakQuick's one-time pricing and 100% local processing make it more privacy-centric for individual users.
